# debug exe location

for some reason debug exe is at this location
```
SURUN.EXE   EXE64_FILE  "..\\DebugU\\SuRun.exe"
SURUNEXT.DLL    EXE64_FILE  "..\\DebugU\\SuRunExt.dll"
SURUN32.BIN EXE64_FILE  "..\\DebugUx64\\SuRun32.bin"
SURUNEXT32.DLL  EXE64_FILE  "..\\DebugUx64\\SuRunExt32.dll"
IDI_MAINICON    ICON    "..\\resources\\SuRun.ico"
```

and InstallSurun was at
`InstallSuRun\Debug\InstallSuRun.exe`

(I might not install it correctly all along...)

# Update 5/10 2025

After cleanup build profiles, InstallSuRun is at "PC/Debug/InstallSuRun.exe".
